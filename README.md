# OpenMW Mod Manager

This is a work-in-progress mod manager for OpenMW.

The goal is to have a simple GUI program for installing, managing and
uninstalling mods, inspired by Wrye Mash and others alike, but with modern code.

Currently the base system and a CLI are being worked on, so there's still a
*long way to go*.
